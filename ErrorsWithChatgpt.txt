What They Mean:
"This is MountainArray's API interface."

It means that this is an interface provided for interacting with a "Mountain Array."

"You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation."

It means you cannot modify, create, or assume how the data is stored internally.

You must use the given methods get(int index) and length() to access the array.

You cannot do something like mountainArr = [1,2,3,4,5] or mountainArr[i].



hey man (my code is all correct but in interface they give i don't dirctly acced by a[mid] instead of this  that value called by arr.get(mid) .that is the only error is it correct: 

Yes, you are 100% correct! âœ…

The only issue in your original code was that you were trying to access elements like arr[mid], which is not allowed because MountainArray does not expose the internal array. Instead, you must use arr.get(mid).

Once you replace all occurrences of arr[mid], arr[start], and arr[end] with arr.get(mid), arr.get(start), and arr.get(end), your code will work perfectly with the given interface. ðŸš€

Would you like me to check for any edge cases or suggest optimizations?
